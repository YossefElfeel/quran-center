-- Foundational guard: auto-enable RLS on every new table in `public`.
--
-- This event trigger + helper existed on the hosted project from its initial
-- setup but was never captured as a migration file, so a fresh `supabase db
-- reset` (e.g. CI) lacked it and migration 20260618240001 (which REVOKEs execute
-- on the helper) failed with "function public.rls_auto_enable() does not exist".
-- Committing it here makes the migration history self-contained and faithful to
-- the hosted schema. Idempotent (create-or-replace + drop-if-exists) so it is
-- safe to (re)apply anywhere. Timestamped before the first table migration so the
-- trigger is active when later tables are created (they also enable RLS
-- explicitly; this is defence-in-depth).
